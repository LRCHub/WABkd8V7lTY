[00:38.90] Two Augusts ago, I told the truth
[00:42.83] Oh, but you didn't like it, you went home
[00:47.21] You're in your Benz, I'm by the gate
[01:05.21] 
[00:55.51] Now you go alone
[00:57.88] Charm all the people you trained for
[01:00.60] You mean well but aim low
[01:03.75] And I'll make it known like I'm getting paid
[01:25.75] 
[01:10.25] That's just the way life goes
[01:14.35] I like to slam doors closed
[01:18.46] Trust me, I know it's always about me
[01:25.38] I love you, I'm sorry
[01:35.88] 
[01:28.52] Two summers from now
[01:30.72] We'll have been talking but not all that often, we're cool now
[01:36.73] I'll be on a boat, you're on a plane
[01:42.38] Going somewhere, same
[01:52.88] 
[01:45.03] And I'll have a drink
[01:47.20] Wistfully lean out my window
[01:50.32] And watch the sun set on the lake
[01:53.33] I might not feel real, but it's okay, mm
[02:13.33] 
[01:59.78] 'Cause that's just the way life goes
[02:03.97] I push my luck, it shows
[02:08.05] Thankful you don't send someone to kill me
[02:14.99] I love you, I'm sorry
[02:25.49] 
[02:17.43] You were the best, but you were the worst
[02:19.37] As sick as it sounds, I loved you first
[02:21.56] I was a dick, it is what it is
[02:23.55] A habit to kick, the age-old curse
[02:40.55] 
[02:25.73] I tend to laugh whenever I'm sad
[02:27.55] I stare at the crash, it actually works
[02:29.84] Making amends, this shit never ends
[02:31.70] I'm wrong again, wrong again
[02:45.70] 
[02:33.77] The way life goes
[02:36.98] Joyriding down our road
[02:41.12] Lay on the horn to prove that it haunts me
[02:48.18] I love you, I'm sorry
[02:58.68] 
[02:50.25] The way life goes
[02:53.51] I want to speak in code
[02:57.63] I hope that I don't, I won't make it about me
[03:04.71] I love you, I'm sorry
